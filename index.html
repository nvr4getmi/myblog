    <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 7 February 2026</p>

    <p>
        Today I am very happy because this is my first blog post!  
        I learned that websites are made using HTML.  
        HTML is easy and fun to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to write more posts about drawing, music, and school.

    <h2>Why I Love Drawing 🎨</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 February 2026</p>

    <p>
        Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies.  
        I like using colors and making new ideas on paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I draw, I feel calm and happy.  
        One day, I want to draw pictures for my own story books.
